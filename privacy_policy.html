            <h3>Nature and Purpose of Processing:</h3>
            <span>When you access our website, i.e., if you do not register or otherwise provide information,
                information of
                a
                general nature is automatically collected. This information (server log files) includes, for example,
                the
                type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your
                IP
                address, and similar.</span>
            <span>They are processed in particular for the following purposes:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring a smooth connection to the website,</li>
                <li>Ensuring smooth use of our website,</li>
                <li>Evaluating system security and stability, and</li>
                <li>Optimizing our website.</li>
            </ul>
            <span>We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Information of this kind is evaluated
                by
                us,
                if necessary, in anonymized statistical form in order to optimize our internet presence and the
                underlying
                technology.</span>
            <h3>Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest:</h3>
            <span>Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR on the basis of our legitimate
                interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website.</span>
            <h3>Recipients:</h3>
            <span>The recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as processors for the operation
                and
                maintenance of our website.</span>
            <span></span>
            <h3>Storage Period:</h3>
            <span>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for the purpose of collection. This
                is
                generally the case for data that serves the provision of the website when the respective session is
                ended.
            </span>
            <span></span>
            <h3>Provision Prescribed or Required:</h3>
            <span>The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually required.
                However,
                without the IP address, the service and functionality of our website cannot be guaranteed. In addition,
                individual services and features may not be available or may be limited. For this reason, an objection
                is
                excluded.</span>
